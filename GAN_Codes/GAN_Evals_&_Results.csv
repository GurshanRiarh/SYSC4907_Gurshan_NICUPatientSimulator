Statistical Method,Heart Rate GAN,Respiratory Rate GAN,Explanation
KS Test,0.1782,0.2032,Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test: Measures the maximum distance between the real and synthetic cumulative distributions. Smaller values indicate closer alignment.
P-Value,0.0834,0.092,"The p-value for the KS Test. If p > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the distributions are the same."
Wasserstein Distance,3.4411,6.888,Also known as the Earth Mover’s Distance; quantifies the 'cost' of transforming one distribution into another. Lower is better.
Real Data Mean,127.2645,67.1746,Average (mean) of the real dataset (BPM or breaths per minute).
Real Data STD,10.8114,24.9199,Standard deviation (spread) of the real dataset. Higher STD indicates greater variability.
Synthetic Data Mean,128.7312,63.9916,Average (mean) of the synthetic dataset generated by the GAN.
Synthetic Data STD,13.156,26.132,Standard deviation of the synthetic dataset. Compare with real data STD to assess variability.
Real Data Skewness,0.2291,0.5939,A measure of asymmetry in the real data distribution. Positive skew indicates a longer or fatter right tail.
Real Data Kurtosis,-0.0856,1.0143,Indicates how 'peaked' or heavy-tailed the real distribution is compared to a normal distribution. Negative = lighter tails; positive = heavier tails.
Synthetic Data Skewness,0.3604,0.4321,Asymmetry of the synthetic data distribution. Compare with real skewness to assess similarity.
Synthetic Data Kurtosis,-1.2705,-0.7654,Peakedness/tail heaviness of the synthetic distribution. Negative values = lighter tails than normal.

KS Test,Results (Heart Rate),Results (Respiratory),
P-Value,Moderate alignment; value suggests some differences but not extreme.,"Moderate alignment; similar interpretation, with slight differences.",
Wasserstein Distance,Slightly above 0.05; indicates no significant difference.,Slightly above 0.05; indicates distributions are statistically similar.,
Real Data Mean,Low value indicates a good match between real and synthetic HR data.,Higher value indicates a larger gap between real and synthetic respiratory data.,
Real Data STD,Baseline for HR; synthetic mean is very close.,Baseline for RR; used to compare synthetic mean.,
Synthetic Data Mean,Lower variability; HR data is relatively consistent.,Higher variability; indicates a wider spread in real RR data.,
Synthetic Data STD,"Very close to the real HR mean, indicating accurate central tendency.","Slightly lower than the real RR mean, suggesting a small bias.",
Real Data Skewness,Slightly higher variability than real HR data.,"Also higher variability than real RR data, suggesting increased spread.",
Real Data Kurtosis,Mild positive skew; slight asymmetry in HR data.,More pronounced positive skew; indicates stronger asymmetry in RR data.,
Synthetic Data Skewness,Slightly flatter than a normal distribution.,"More peaked or heavy-tailed, indicating more extreme values in RR data.",
Synthetic Data Kurtosis,"Slightly higher skew than real HR data, but generally similar.","Slightly lower skew than real RR data, indicating a small difference in asymmetry.",
,"Much lighter tails than real HR data, indicating underrepresentation of extreme values.","Lighter tails than real RR data, though closer to real values than HR synthetic.",
